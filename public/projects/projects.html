        <p class="title">Time clock tracking tool for Wizkids made using Java and the Spring Framework</p>
        <p class="subtitle">A project done in cooperation with the educational company Wizkids</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This was a project we did in a team of 4 as an exam project in our 2. semester. We made the system for the company Wishkids located in Copenhagen who wanted a way for their employees to register their work hours.</p>
            <p>The whole project was done using Java and the Spring Framework and its libraries with an added MySQL database.</p>
            <p>Simple styling was added using regular CSS</p>
            <p>For project control we used Unified Process which is usually meant for bigger projects, but it ended up working well with this project and gave us a great inside of this development process it self.</p>
            <p>The entire project is available on my Github: <a href="https://github.com/olra0312/first-year-exam-project">Session time project</a>.</p>

        <p class="title">ShopStudieBøger.dk</p>
        <p class="subtitle">A web-application made in the NodeJS environment using express and autherisation</p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This project was of our own creation. We wanted to make a website for students who wanted to buy used books for their education.</p>
            <p>Much like the danish website DBA.dk, we wanted our users to be able to login to their account and either sell your books by creating an ad, or buying books from other users' ads.</p>
            <p>We used MySQL as our database and the SQL query builder, Knex, for setting it all up.</p>
            <p>Dor this project we used the Scrum-framework which worked really well. At this point in time the Covid-19 epidemic was roaming the earth, which made this project a bit more difficult to handle.</p>
            <p>To accommedate this we made great use of a combination of Github, Discord for screen sharing, Google Drive, for our files and artefacts, and Trello.com as an online Scrum-board. We used a Gantt-scheme to track to progress of the project.</p>

            <p class="title">A canteen system for Wizkids made using Java and the Spring Framework</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Once again we were invited to make a project for Wizkids.</p>
            <div class="content">
                <p>This system would be a lot bigger than the previous one. The system should have a login screen with added authorities.</p>
                <p>The system was meant for both the cafeteria employees as well as the programmers and other employees at the company.</p>
                <p>We made a shared login screen, and dependning on which type of employee logs in, it will take them to each their manu.</p>
                <p>The canteen personel can create dished that can be ordered from the employee page. The canteebn persenel will then get a list of the ordered dishes.</p>
                <p>There's also some added functionality like a forum, a help menu and so on.</p>
                <p>The project was again made using Java and the Spring Framework with an added MySQL Database.</p>
                <p>On this project we also used Bulma as a CSS Framework to style the program.</p>
                <p>To control the project we used an altered V-Model and Gantt-scheme.</p>
                <p>The project is available on my Github: <a href="https://github.com/olra0312/wizkidscanteenprogram">Canteen Program</a></p>
